## Featured Project: Learning DSA with Music

### Overview

**Learning DSA with Music** is an educational platform that teaches Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through music concepts. By drawing parallels between musical patterns and computational thinking, we make complex CS topics more intuitive and memorable.

### Who Is This For?

- 🎵 **Beginners** starting their coding journey
- 🎓 **Students** learning data structures and algorithms
- 🎹 **Music enthusiasts** curious about programming
- 👨‍💻 **Developers** looking for creative approaches to understanding DSA

### What You'll Find

- **Code Examples**: Python implementations of DSA concepts using musical analogies
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides connecting music theory to algorithms
- **Interactive Learning**: Hands-on exercises that make learning engaging

### Topics Covered

- Arrays & Lists ↔ Musical Scales & Sequences
- Stacks & Queues ↔ Musical Notation & Playback
- Trees ↔ Chord Progressions & Harmonic Structure
- Graphs ↔ Music Theory Relationships
- Sorting Algorithms ↔ Organizing Musical Elements
- Recursion ↔ Musical Patterns & Repetition

### Technologies

- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**: NumPy, pandas, music21 (and more)
